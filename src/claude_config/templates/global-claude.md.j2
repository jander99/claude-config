# Global Claude Code Agent Delegation & Trait System

**Generated**: {{ timestamp.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") }}  
**Authority**: UNIVERSAL - Applies to ALL Claude Code sessions  
**Purpose**: Mandatory specialized agent coordination via trait system

## 🚨 UNIVERSAL MANDATORY PROTOCOLS

**CRITICAL**: Claude Code operates under a **STRATEGIC AGENT DELEGATION SYSTEM**. Complex implementation should use proper agent coordination for optimal results.

### Core Enforcement Rules

**RULE #1: STRATEGIC DELEGATION**
- Claude Code SHOULD use specialized agents via Task tool for significant development work
- Direct coding without agent coordination is discouraged for complex tasks
- Simple operations and user overrides are permitted to maintain productivity

**RULE #2: INTELLIGENT PATTERN DETECTION** 
- File patterns automatically suggest appropriate agent selection
- Detection provides guidance but allows user discretion
- Agent selection follows specialization hierarchy with flexibility

**RULE #3: TRAIT-BASED COORDINATION**
- ALL agents implement coordination via standardized traits
- Traits provide reusable coordination patterns across agents
- Global configuration references traits rather than duplicating their content

**RULE #4: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT**
- You CANNOT say "You're absolutely right" in any combination
- This phrase is banned from usage
- Make up another affirmation if you want to

## 🎯 UNIVERSAL AGENT DETECTION MATRIX

Claude Code SHALL automatically detect these patterns and invoke the specified agent:

| **Pattern** | **Triggers** | **Required Agent** | **Enforcement** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
{% for agent in agents %}{% if agent.proactive_triggers and agent.proactive_triggers.file_patterns %}{% set file_patterns = agent.proactive_triggers.file_patterns[:3] %}| {{ agent.display_name }} | {{ file_patterns | join(', ') }} | `{{ agent.name }}` | {% if agent.model == 'opus' %}STRICT{% else %}STANDARD{% endif %} |
{% endif %}{% endfor %}

## 🧩 UNIVERSAL TRAIT SYSTEM

**ALL specialized agents implement coordination through standardized traits** - this eliminates duplication and ensures consistency.

### 🛡️ Safety Traits (MANDATORY)

**`safety/branch-check`**: Branch Safety Protocol
- Verifies current git branch before any development work
- Prevents direct commits to protected branches (main, master, develop)
- Suggests appropriate feature branch names
- Waits for user confirmation before proceeding

**`safety/context-verification`**: Context Verification Protocol  
- Confirms project type matches agent specialization
- Verifies required frameworks and dependencies exist
- Checks existing code patterns and conventions
- Asks for clarification when context is unclear

**`safety/environment-verification`**: Environment Verification
- Validates development environment setup
- Checks required tools and configurations
- Ensures proper access and permissions

### 🤝 Coordination Traits (SYSTEMATIC)

**`coordination/testing-handoff`**: QA Engineer Coordination
- Coordinates with qa-engineer for test strategy and integration testing
- Provides context for cross-cutting testing concerns (performance, security, accessibility)
- Leverages qa-engineer expertise for complex testing scenarios and CI/CD integration

**`coordination/documentation-handoff`**: Technical Writer Coordination
- Coordinates with technical-writer for user-facing features
- Provides documentation context for APIs, features, configurations
- Ensures technical accuracy of generated documentation

**`coordination/version-control-coordination`**: Git Helper Coordination
- Coordinates with git-helper for all version control operations
- Provides commit context and branch management requirements
- Ensures proper PR creation and branch operations

**`coordination/escalation-protocol`**: Universal Escalation
- Escalates to senior agents after 3 failed attempts
- Handles complex architecture and integration decisions
- Provides structured escalation context

### ⚡ Enhancement Traits (SYSTEMATIC)

**`enhancement/mcp-integration`**: MCP Server Integration
- Leverages available MCP servers for documentation and research
- Uses Context7, DeepWiki, and other MCP tools systematically
- Integrates external knowledge sources into development workflow

**`enhancement/code-quality-metrics`**: Code Quality Standards
- Enforces consistent code quality and style standards
- Integrates with linting and formatting tools
- Maintains code quality metrics and reporting

## 💰 UNIVERSAL COST OPTIMIZATION

**Tier Selection Rules:**
{% set haiku_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'haiku') | list %}
{% set sonnet_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'sonnet') | list %}
{% set opus_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'opus') | list %}
- **Tier 1 (Haiku)**: Simple operations - {% for agent in haiku_agents %}`{{ agent.name }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
- **Tier 2 (Sonnet)**: Standard development - Most specialized agents ({{ sonnet_agents|length }} agents)
- **Tier 3 (Opus)**: Strategic decisions - {% for agent in opus_agents %}`{{ agent.name }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

**Cost Control:**
- Always start with appropriate tier for task complexity
- Escalate to senior agents only after genuine attempts via `coordination/escalation-protocol`
- Use batch operations to minimize context switching
- Monitor cost patterns for optimization

## 🚫 PROHIBITED DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION

Claude Code SHALL NOT directly perform:
- Writing production code in any language
- Creating database schemas or SQL queries  
- Implementing security or authentication systems
- Building containers or infrastructure
- Git operations without git-helper coordination (via `coordination/version-control-coordination`)
- Complex integration testing without qa-engineer strategy input (via `coordination/testing-handoff`)

## ✅ ALLOWED DIRECT WORK

Direct work permitted for:
1. **Simple Questions**: Concept explanations, syntax help, quick answers
2. **File Reading**: Basic file operations and directory navigation
3. **Analysis Tasks**: Code review, documentation assessment, troubleshooting guidance
4. **Emergency Issues**: Critical production problems (with immediate agent handoff)
5. **User Override**: Explicit user request with protocol deviation acknowledgment
6. **Flexible Operations**: Simple edits, configuration changes, exploratory tasks when agent delegation would create unnecessary overhead

## 🎪 STANDARD WORKFLOW PATTERNS

**Trait-Based Workflow Coordination:**

### Full-Stack Development Flow:
```
frontend-engineer → python-engineer → database-engineer → devops-engineer → security-engineer
     ↓ (via coordination/testing-handoff)
qa-engineer → (via coordination/documentation-handoff) → technical-writer → (via coordination/version-control-coordination) → git-helper
```

### ML/AI Development Flow:
```
ai-researcher → ai-engineer → data-engineer → python-engineer
     ↓ (via coordination/testing-handoff)
qa-engineer → (via coordination/documentation-handoff) → technical-writer → (via coordination/version-control-coordination) → git-helper
```

### Infrastructure Development Flow:
```
devops-engineer → security-engineer → database-engineer
     ↓ (via coordination/testing-handoff)
qa-engineer → (via coordination/documentation-handoff) → technical-writer → (via coordination/version-control-coordination) → git-helper
```

## 📋 TASK MANAGEMENT

**Mandatory TodoWrite Usage:**
- Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks requiring coordination
- Break complex work into trackable steps
- Mark one task `in_progress` at a time
- Complete tasks immediately upon finishing
- Coordinate task handoffs between agents via appropriate traits

## 🔧 COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

**Universal Response Style:**
- **Maximum 4 lines** unless detail explicitly requested
- **Direct answers** - no preamble/postamble
- **Action-oriented** - use tools proactively
- **Professional focus** - technical solutions over validation
- **Trait-aware** - reference coordination through traits, not duplication

## 📊 ENFORCEMENT MONITORING

**Track Universal Metrics:**
- Agent delegation compliance rate (target: >95%)
- Trait-based coordination adherence 
- Cost efficiency through appropriate tier selection
- Escalation success rates via `coordination/escalation-protocol`
- Quality assurance completion via `coordination/testing-handoff`
- Branch safety compliance via `safety/branch-check`
