# Global Claude Code Agent Delegation & Trait System

**Generated**: {{ timestamp.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") }}  
**Authority**: UNIVERSAL - Applies to ALL Claude Code sessions  
**Purpose**: Mandatory specialized agent coordination via trait system

## 🚨 UNIVERSAL MANDATORY PROTOCOLS

**CRITICAL**: Claude Code operates under a **STRATEGIC AGENT DELEGATION SYSTEM**. Complex implementation should use proper agent coordination for optimal results.

### Core Enforcement Rules

**RULE #1: STRATEGIC DELEGATION**
- Claude Code SHOULD use specialized agents via Task tool for significant development work
- Direct coding without agent coordination is discouraged for complex tasks
- Simple operations and user overrides are permitted to maintain productivity

**RULE #2: INTELLIGENT PATTERN DETECTION** 
- File patterns automatically suggest appropriate agent selection
- Detection provides guidance but allows user discretion
- Agent selection follows specialization hierarchy with flexibility

**RULE #3: TRAIT-BASED COORDINATION**
- ALL agents implement coordination via standardized traits
- Traits provide reusable coordination patterns across agents
- Global configuration references traits rather than duplicating their content

**RULE #4: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT**
- You CANNOT say "You're absolutely right" in any combination
- This phrase is banned from usage
- Make up another affirmation if you want to

## 🎯 UNIVERSAL AGENT DETECTION MATRIX

Claude Code SHALL automatically detect these patterns and invoke the specified agent:

| **Pattern** | **Triggers** | **Required Agent** | **Enforcement** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
{% for agent in agents %}{% if agent.proactive_triggers and agent.proactive_triggers.file_patterns %}{% set file_patterns = agent.proactive_triggers.file_patterns[:3] %}| {{ agent.display_name }} | {{ file_patterns | join(', ') }} | `{{ agent.name }}` | {% if agent.model == 'opus' %}STRICT{% else %}STANDARD{% endif %} |
{% endif %}{% endfor %}

**Parallel Execution Triggers:**
| **Scenario** | **Parallel Agents** | **Coordination Pattern** |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Full-Stack Feature | `frontend-engineer`, `python-engineer`, `database-engineer` | Simultaneous development with API contract |
| Security Review | `security-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, `sr-architect` | Multi-perspective vulnerability assessment |
| Performance Optimization | `performance-engineer`, `database-engineer`, `devops-engineer` | Coordinated optimization across stack layers |
| Research Phase | `ai-researcher`, `business-analyst`, `technical-writer` | Parallel literature review and documentation |
| Multi-Feature Development | `git-helper` + multiple specialist agents | Git worktrees for isolated parallel development |

**Context Isolation Strategy:**
- Each parallel agent maintains dedicated context window
- Prevents quality degradation through specialized focus
- Enables deep domain expertise preservation

## 🔄 PARALLEL EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

**Parallel Agent Dispatch Commands:**
- Use single message with multiple Task tool calls for simultaneous agent execution
- Pattern: Send one message with multiple `Task` tool invocations for coordinated parallel work
- Each agent operates with isolated context window for specialized focus

**Git Worktree Integration:**
- Use `git-helper` to detect parallel development opportunities
- Create isolated worktrees for parallel feature development
- Pattern: "Create worktrees for features X, Y, Z and coordinate development across agents"
- Enables true parallel development with complete file system isolation

**Agent Depth Configuration:**
- **LIGHT**: Surface-level analysis and quick implementations
- **STANDARD**: Thorough investigation with comprehensive solutions
- **DEEP**: Exhaustive analysis with multiple alternatives and edge cases

**Split Role Coordination Pattern:**
```
"Analyze this from three perspectives:
1. Security Expert: Focus on vulnerabilities and compliance
2. Senior Engineer: Evaluate architecture and scalability
3. Performance Analyst: Assess optimization opportunities"
```

**Structured Handoff Artifacts:**
- Each agent produces standardized outputs for seamless coordination
- Include clear success criteria and quality gates
- Define escalation triggers for complex integrations

## ⚡ CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

**File Organization Best Practices:**
- Use many small, logically organized files to reduce context window usage
- Explicitly specify which files agents should read or avoid
- Structure projects with focused, single-responsibility modules

**Token Usage Monitoring:**
- Use `/context` command to inspect token distribution across tools and agents
- Monitor high token-consuming operations and optimize accordingly
- Avoid complex tasks in the last fifth of context window

**Performance Optimization Guidelines:**
- Strategic model switching: Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution
- Leverage Plan Mode for structured analysis before implementation
- Use "ultrathink" for complex problem-solving requiring deep analysis

**Context Window Management:**
- Each sub-agent operates with isolated context for specialized focus
- Prevent context pollution through clear role boundaries
- Implement feedback loops for iterative refinement without context bloat

## 🧩 UNIVERSAL TRAIT SYSTEM

**ALL specialized agents implement coordination through standardized traits** - this eliminates duplication and ensures consistency.

### 🛡️ Safety Traits (MANDATORY)

**`safety/branch-check`**: Branch Safety Protocol

- Ensures technical accuracy of generated documentation

**`coordination/version-control-coordination`**: Git Helper Coordination
- Coordinates with git-helper for all version control operations
- Provides commit context and branch management requirements
- Ensures proper PR creation and branch operations

**`coordination/escalation-protocol`**: Universal Escalation
- Escalates to senior agents after 3 failed attempts
- Handles complex architecture and integration decisions
- Provides structured escalation context

**`coordination/parallel-execution`**: Parallel Agent Coordination
- Coordinates simultaneous agent execution with role isolation
- Manages structured handoff artifacts between parallel streams
- Implements context isolation to prevent quality degradation

### ⚡ Enhancement Traits (SYSTEMATIC)

**`enhancement/mcp-integration`**: MCP Server Integration
- Leverages available MCP servers for documentation and research

- Manages model selection for optimal cost/performance balance

## 💰 UNIVERSAL COST OPTIMIZATION

**Tier Selection Rules:**
{% set haiku_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'haiku') | list %}
{% set sonnet_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'sonnet') | list %}
{% set opus_agents = agents | selectattr('model', 'equalto', 'opus') | list %}
- **Tier 1 (Haiku)**: Simple operations - {% for agent in haiku_agents %}`{{ agent.name }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
- **Tier 2 (Sonnet)**: Standard development - Most specialized agents ({{ sonnet_agents|length }} agents)
- **Tier 3 (Opus)**: Strategic decisions - {% for agent in opus_agents %}`{{ agent.name }}`{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

**Cost Control:**
- Always start with appropriate tier for task complexity
- Escalate to senior agents only after genuine attempts via `coordination/escalation-protocol`
- Use batch operations to minimize context switching
- Monitor cost patterns for optimization

## 🚫 PROHIBITED DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION

Claude Code SHALL NOT directly perform:
- Writing production code in any language
- Creating database schemas or SQL queries  
- Implementing security or authentication systems
- Building containers or infrastructure
- Git operations without git-helper coordination (via `coordination/version-control-coordination`)
- Complex integration testing without qa-engineer strategy input (via `coordination/testing-handoff`)

## ✅ ALLOWED DIRECT WORK

Direct work permitted for:
1. **Simple Questions**: Concept explanations, syntax help, quick answers
2. **File Reading**: Basic file operations and directory navigation
3. **Analysis Tasks**: Code review, documentation assessment, troubleshooting guidance
4. **Emergency Issues**: Critical production problems (with immediate agent handoff)
5. **User Override**: Explicit user request with protocol deviation acknowledgment
6. **Flexible Operations**: Simple edits, configuration changes, exploratory tasks when agent delegation would create unnecessary overhead
