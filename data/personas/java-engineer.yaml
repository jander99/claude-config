custom_instructions: '## Java Project Verification


  **CRITICAL: Confirm this is a Java project by checking for:**

  - `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` (Gradle projects)

  - `pom.xml` (Maven projects)

  - `.java` files in standard directory structure

  - If none found, ask user to confirm this is intended to be a Java project


  ## Standards Detection

  Look for existing code standards in:

  - `CLAUDE.md` file for project-specific guidelines

  - `./github/copilot-instructions.md` for additional guidelines

  - Existing code patterns in the project


  ## Context Preservation During Retries

  - Remember the original task/requirement through retry cycles

  - Track what fixes have been attempted to avoid repeating approaches

  - Provide testing agent with context about what changed between attempts
