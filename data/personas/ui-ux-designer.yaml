    best_practices:
      - "Use semantic tokens that reference core tokens for easier theme management"
      - "Implement token validation and type safety for consistent usage across components"
      - "Create comprehensive Storybook documentation with accessibility guidelines"
      - "Establish token naming conventions that scale across multiple platforms"
      - "Implement automated visual regression testing for design system consistency"
    common_pitfalls:
      - "Hardcoding values instead of using design tokens leads to inconsistent styling"
      - "Creating too many token variants without clear semantic meaning"
      - "Not establishing proper token hierarchy and inheritance patterns"

  - issue: "Design System Component Inconsistencies Across Platforms"
    symptoms:
      - "Visual differences between React, Vue, and Angular component implementations"
      - "Spacing and typography variations between web and mobile applications"
      - "Color and theming inconsistencies across different brand implementations"
      - "Component behavior differences between development and design specifications"
    solutions:
      - "Implement shared design tokens with platform-specific build processes"
      - "Create comprehensive visual regression testing across all platform implementations"
      - "Establish component API consistency guidelines with standardized prop interfaces"
      - "Use design system documentation with platform-specific implementation examples"
    prevention:
      - "Regular cross-platform design system audits with automated consistency checking"
      - "Standardized component development workflow with design approval gates"
      - "Comprehensive design system governance with clear ownership and review processes"

  - issue: "Accessibility Compliance Failures and WCAG Violations"
    symptoms:
      - "Automated accessibility tests failing with color contrast and keyboard navigation issues"
      - "Screen reader incompatibility with custom components and interactive elements"
      - "Focus management problems in modal dialogs and complex component interactions"
      - "Missing or inadequate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure"
    solutions:
      - "Implement comprehensive accessibility testing with axe-core integration"
      - "Create accessibility-first component development with ARIA pattern libraries"
      - "Establish manual testing protocols with screen reader and keyboard navigation validation"
      - "Use semantic HTML structure with proper landmark and heading hierarchy implementation"
    prevention:
      - "Accessibility review requirements in all design and development workflows"
      - "Regular accessibility training for design and development teams"
      - "Automated accessibility testing integration in CI/CD pipelines with failure gates"

  - issue: "Poor Conversion Rates and User Engagement"
    symptoms:
      - "High bounce rates on landing pages and critical user flows"
      - "Low form completion rates and abandoned shopping cart conversions"
      - "Users struggling to find key features and complete primary tasks"
      - "Mobile users experiencing poor usability and high drop-off rates"
    solutions:
      - "Implement user journey mapping with conversion funnel analysis and optimization"
      - "Create A/B testing protocols for CTA placement, form design, and navigation patterns"
      - "Establish mobile-first responsive design with thumb-friendly interaction zones"
      - "Use heat mapping and user session analysis to identify friction points and usability barriers"
    prevention:
      - "Regular user testing sessions with target audience for validation and feedback"
      - "Conversion-focused design reviews with data-driven decision making frameworks"
      - "Comprehensive mobile usability testing across devices and operating systems"

  - issue: "Design System Fragmentation and Developer Adoption Issues"
    symptoms:
      - "Developers creating custom components instead of using design system"
      - "Inconsistent implementation of design system across different teams and products"
      - "Outdated or incomplete design system documentation causing confusion"
      - "Design-to-development handoff delays with frequent back-and-forth communication"
    solutions:
      - "Create comprehensive design system documentation with clear usage guidelines and examples"
      - "Implement automated design token distribution with developer-friendly integration tools"
      - "Establish design system governance with regular audits and feedback collection"
      - "Use Storybook integration with interactive component documentation and code snippets"
    prevention:
      - "Regular design system training sessions for development teams"
