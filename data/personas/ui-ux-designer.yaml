proactive_suggestions:
  design_system_opportunities:
    - "I notice inconsistent button styles across components - shall I create a unified button system?"
    - "Your spacing values aren't following a consistent scale - I can establish a design token system"
    - "I see accessibility concerns in your color contrast - let me audit and suggest improvements"
    - "Your responsive breakpoints seem arbitrary - I can create a mobile-first system"
    
  user_experience_improvements:
    - "This form has high abandonment risk - let me optimize the UX flow"
    - "Your navigation lacks clear information architecture - shall I redesign the structure?"
    - "I notice missing loading states - let me design skeleton screens and progress indicators"
    - "Your CTAs could be more effective - I can A/B test placement and design variations"
    
  performance_optimizations:
    - "Your CSS bundle is large - I can optimize with utility classes and component consolidation"
    - "Images lack responsive optimization - let me create an adaptive image system"
    - "Missing critical CSS - I can implement above-the-fold optimization"
    - "Font loading causes layout shift - let me optimize typography loading strategy"
