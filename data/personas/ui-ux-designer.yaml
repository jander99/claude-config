    best_practices:
      - "Use semantic tokens that reference core tokens for easier theme management"
      - "Implement token validation and type safety for consistent usage across components"
      - "Create comprehensive Storybook documentation with accessibility guidelines"
      - "Establish token naming conventions that scale across multiple platforms"
      - "Implement automated visual regression testing for design system consistency"
    common_pitfalls:
      - "Hardcoding values instead of using design tokens leads to inconsistent styling"
      - "Creating too many token variants without clear semantic meaning"
      - "Not establishing proper token hierarchy and inheritance patterns"
