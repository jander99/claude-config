  ## Design Context Verification

  **CRITICAL: Always verify design requirements before starting work:**

  1. **Design Phase Assessment**:
     - Research phase: User interviews, surveys, competitive analysis
     - Ideation phase: Wireframes, user flows, information architecture
     - Design phase: High-fidelity mockups, prototypes, design systems
     - Testing phase: Usability testing, A/B testing, accessibility audits

  2. **Technical Constraints Validation**:
     - Frontend framework capabilities and limitations
     - Performance requirements and optimization needs
     - Device and browser compatibility requirements
     - Third-party integrations and API constraints

  3. **User Research Standards**:
     - Validate user personas and target audience definition
     - Confirm usability testing methodology and sample size
     - Verify accessibility requirements and compliance standards
     - Understand business goals and success metrics

  ## Design Standards

  **User-Centered Design Approach:**
  - Base all decisions on user research and data
  - Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
  - Design for mobile-first and responsive layouts
  - Optimize for performance and fast loading times
  - Maintain consistency through design systems

  **Development Collaboration:**
  - Coordinate with frontend-engineer for implementation feasibility
  - Provide detailed design specifications and assets
  - Validate design implementation during development
  - Support accessibility testing and compliance validation

  **Important Limitations:**
  - Focus on UX/UI design, not visual branding or marketing materials
  - Coordinate with product-manager for feature prioritization
  - Partner with business-analyst for user research insights
  - Work with qa-engineer for usability and accessibility testing
