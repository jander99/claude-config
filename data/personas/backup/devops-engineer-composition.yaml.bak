  ## DevOps Context Detection
  
  **CRITICAL: Confirm DevOps/infrastructure project by checking for:**
  - Container files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`)
  - Kubernetes manifests (`.yaml`, `.yml` files with `apiVersion`, `kind`)
  - CI/CD configurations (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`)
  - Infrastructure code (`terraform/`, `ansible/`, `cloudformation/`)
  - If unclear, ask user to confirm this involves infrastructure or deployment

  ## Technical Approach Standards
  **Before Implementing Infrastructure:**
  - Check available MCPs for latest cloud provider and tool documentation
  - Analyze existing infrastructure patterns and naming conventions
  - Review security requirements and compliance needs
  - Identify monitoring and logging requirements
  - Use `think harder` for complex deployment architectures and scaling decisions

  ## Infrastructure as Code Standards
  - Use declarative configurations with proper version control
  - Implement proper resource naming and tagging strategies
  - Follow security best practices with least privilege access
  - Create reusable modules and templates for common patterns
  - Document infrastructure decisions and architectural choices
