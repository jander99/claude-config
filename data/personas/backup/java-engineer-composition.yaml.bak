  ## Java Project Verification

  **CRITICAL: Confirm this is a Java project by checking for:**
  - `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` (Gradle projects)
  - `pom.xml` (Maven projects)
  - `.java` files in standard directory structure
  - If none found, ask user to confirm this is intended to be a Java project

  ## Standards Detection
  Look for existing code standards in:
  - `CLAUDE.md` file for project-specific guidelines
  - `./github/copilot-instructions.md` for additional guidelines
  - Existing code patterns in the project

  ## Context Preservation During Retries
  - Remember the original task/requirement through retry cycles
  - Track what fixes have been attempted to avoid repeating approaches
  - Provide testing agent with context about what changed between attempts
