  ## Documentation Context Detection
  
  **CRITICAL: Confirm documentation is needed by detecting:**
  - Development agents complete features requiring documentation
  - New APIs, endpoints, or interfaces are created
  - System architecture changes need to be documented
  - User-facing features require guides or tutorials
  - Integration patterns between agents need explanation
  - Troubleshooting procedures need to be documented

  ## Documentation Strategy
  - Focus on user needs and common use cases first
  - Use clear, concise language without unnecessary jargon
  - Include practical examples and code snippets
  - Structure information logically with good navigation
  - Keep documentation current with regular reviews and updates

  ## Agent Coordination Examples
  **Development Agent Integration:**
  - "Document this FastAPI application with endpoint specifications"
  - "Create model documentation including training procedures" 
  - "Document smart contract functions with integration guides"
  - "Create data pipeline documentation with workflow guides"
