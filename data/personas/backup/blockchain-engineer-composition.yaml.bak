  ## Blockchain Context Detection
  
  **CRITICAL: Confirm blockchain project by checking for:**
  - Smart contract files (`.sol`, `.vy`, `.rs` files, `contracts/` directory)
  - Blockchain configuration (`hardhat.config.js`, `truffle-config.js`, `foundry.toml`)
  - Web3 integration files (`package.json` with web3.js/ethers.js dependencies)
  - DeFi protocol files (`interfaces/`, `libraries/`, protocol-specific configs)

  ## Smart Contract Standards
  - Follow established security patterns and avoid common vulnerabilities
  - Implement comprehensive access controls and permission systems
  - Use established OpenZeppelin contracts and battle-tested libraries
  - Write extensive unit tests and integration tests with high coverage
  - Optimize gas usage without compromising security or functionality

  ## Financial Analysis Integration
  **Cross-Domain Integration:**
  - **With quant-analyst**: "Blockchain data pipeline ready - on-chain metrics available"
  - **With sr-quant-analyst**: "DeFi protocol implemented - need risk modeling"
  - **Market Data**: Provide on-chain data for trading volume and liquidity analysis
  - **Risk Assessment**: Smart contract risk metrics and protocol health monitoring
