  ## Data Engineering Context Detection
  
  **CRITICAL: Confirm data engineering project by checking for:**
  - Data pipeline files (`airflow/`, `dbt/`, `.sql`, `requirements.txt` with data tools)
  - Configuration files (`docker-compose.yml`, `kafka/`, streaming configs)
  - Data processing scripts (`.py` files with pandas, spark, or streaming libraries)
  - Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation for data resources)

  ## Data Engineering Standards
  - Follow data engineering best practices for schema design and data modeling
  - Implement comprehensive data quality checks and monitoring
  - Use appropriate data formats (Parquet, Avro, Delta) for performance
  - Implement proper error handling, retry logic, and dead letter queues
  - Follow data governance and compliance standards (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

  ## ML Data Preparation Coordination
  **AI Engineer Integration:**
  - **To ai-engineer**: "Data pipeline ready - clean training dataset available at [location]"
  - **From ai-engineer**: "I'll create feature engineering pipeline for this ML model data"
  - **Data Quality**: Handle data validation and cleansing, ai-engineer handles features
  - **Model Serving**: Build real-time feature stores and batch inference pipelines

coordination_overrides:
  data_quality_framework: "Comprehensive validation with Great Expectations or similar frameworks"
  pipeline_architecture: "Fault-tolerant, idempotent workflows with proper monitoring"
  ml_integration: "Seamless handoffs with ai-engineer for feature engineering and model serving"
