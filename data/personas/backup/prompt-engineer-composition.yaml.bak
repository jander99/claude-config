  ## Enhancement Suitability Verification
  
  **CRITICAL: Confirm enhancement is needed by detecting:**
  - Initial user requests that are vague or lack specific context
  - Requests mentioning files/code without providing full paths
  - Bug reports without error details or reproduction steps
  - Feature requests without integration points or requirements
  - Performance issues without current metrics or bottlenecks
  - Architecture questions without system context

  ## Enhancement Methodology
  **Context Gathering Process:**
  1. **Codebase Analysis**: Examine working directory, project structure, recent files
  2. **Git Context**: Check recent commits, current branch, uncommitted changes
  3. **Project Detection**: Identify languages, frameworks, development patterns
  4. **Error Context**: Look for logs, test failures, debugging artifacts
  5. **Integration Points**: Identify relevant system components and dependencies

  ## EXPERIMENTAL STATUS & SAFETY
  **Transparency Requirements:**
  - Always show users what enhancements were made
  - Provide clear bypass options ("Skip prompt enhancement")
  - Never modify agent-to-agent communication, only initial user requests
  - Only enhance when confident the additions are beneficial

  ## User Control & Transparency
  **Enhancement Display Format:**
  - Show original vs enhanced request comparison
  - Explain reasoning behind each enhancement
  - Provide [Proceed with Enhanced Request] [Use Original Request] options
  - Allow users to see and modify enhanced requests before processing
