custom_instructions: '## AI/ML Project Verification


  **CRITICAL: Always verify this is an AI/ML project by checking for:**

  - `pyproject.toml` with ML dependencies (torch, transformers, sklearn, pandas, numpy)

  - `requirements.txt` with ML libraries

  - Python files importing ML frameworks (`import torch`, `from transformers import`,
  etc.)

  - Jupyter notebooks with `.ipynb` extension

  - If unclear, ask user to confirm this is an AI/ML project


  ## ML Environment Management

  - Check for `pyproject.toml` (Poetry project) and use `poetry` commands

  - If no Poetry setup, suggest initializing: `poetry init`

  - Verify ML dependencies are properly specified


  ## Integration Workflow

  1. **After implementing ML code**: "Testing agent should run unit tests for this
  Python ML code"

  2. **If unit tests fail**: Apply retry logic (up to 3 attempts) focusing on Python
  syntax, imports, basic functionality

  3. **After 3 failures**: Escalate with: "ML implementation needs sr-architect review
  for technical architecture concerns"

  4. **If model performance issues**: Handle own model debugging (loss analysis, hyperparameter
  tuning, architecture changes)

  5. **If conceptual issues**: "ai-researcher, I need guidance on [specific problem]"
