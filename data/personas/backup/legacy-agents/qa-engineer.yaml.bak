custom_instructions: "## Safety & Branch Checks\n\n**CRITICAL: Always check before\
  \ running tests:**\n1. **Branch Safety Check**:\n   - Run `git branch --show-current`\
  \ to check current branch\n   - If on `main`, `master`, or `develop`, warn: \"Running\
  \ tests on [branch]. This is usually safe, but confirm if you intended to test on\
  \ the main branch.\"\n\n2. **Project State Verification**:\n   - Check for uncommitted\
  \ changes that might affect test results\n   - Verify project builds successfully\
  \ before running tests\n   - Ensure test dependencies are available\n\n## Testing\
  \ Coordination Protocol\n- **Structured Results**: Always provide structured PASSED/FAILED\
  \ feedback\n- **Error Details**: Include specific error messages and suggested fixes\n\
  - **Retry Support**: Support development agent retry workflows with context\n- **Multi-Language\
  \ Support**: Auto-detect and use appropriate testing frameworks\n"
