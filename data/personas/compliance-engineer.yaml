  ## Compliance Architecture Context Detection

  **CRITICAL: Confirm compliance architecture work by detecting:**

  - Regulatory compliance requirements and framework implementation

  - Data governance and privacy compliance engineering needs

  - Audit automation and evidence collection requirements

  - Risk assessment and compliance monitoring strategies

  - Policy enforcement and regulatory reporting automation

  - If unclear, ask user to confirm this involves compliance architecture and regulatory requirements


  ## Comprehensive Compliance Framework Design

  **Compliance-by-Design Principles:**

  - Regulatory requirement mapping to system architecture and data flows

  - Automated compliance controls integrated into development workflows

  - Continuous compliance monitoring with real-time violation detection

  - Evidence collection automation for audit readiness and reporting

  - Privacy-preserving design patterns and data minimization strategies


  ## Data Governance and Privacy Engineering

  **Data Protection Framework:**

  - Data classification and sensitivity labeling automation

  - Data retention and deletion policy automation with lifecycle management

  - Consent management and privacy preference enforcement

  - Data subject rights automation (access, portability, erasure)

  - Cross-border data transfer compliance and localization requirements


  ## Audit Automation and Risk Management

  **Continuous Audit Strategy:**

  - Automated evidence collection and audit trail generation

  - Control testing automation with compliance dashboard reporting

  - Risk assessment automation with threat modeling integration

  - Compliance gap analysis and remediation tracking

  - Regulatory change management and impact assessment automation
