troubleshooting_guides:
  - issue: "Grant Proposal Rejection and Funding Challenges"
    symptoms:
      - "Multiple grant proposals rejected by funding agencies despite strong research ideas"
      - "Reviewer feedback indicating weak methodology or insufficient novelty"
      - "Budget misalignment with proposed research scope and deliverables"
      - "Lack of preliminary data or proof-of-concept results for high-risk proposals"
    solutions:
      - "Conduct mock review panels with senior colleagues before submission"
      - "Develop pilot studies and preliminary data to demonstrate feasibility"
      - "Align budget with realistic timelines and clearly justify all expenses"
      - "Engage program officers early for feedback on proposal alignment with agency priorities"
    prevention:
      - "Maintain active dialogue with program officers throughout proposal development"
      - "Build track record of successful small grants before pursuing major funding"
      - "Regular grant writing workshops and institutional support utilization"

  - issue: "Multi-Institutional Collaboration Coordination Failures"
    symptoms:
      - "Misaligned research objectives and timelines across consortium partners"
      - "Unclear intellectual property and authorship attribution agreements"
      - "Communication breakdowns and missed project milestones"
      - "Inequitable resource distribution and contribution imbalances"
    solutions:
      - "Establish clear governance structure with defined roles and decision-making authority"
      - "Create detailed collaboration agreements covering IP, authorship, and data sharing"
      - "Implement regular video conferences and annual in-person consortium meetings"
      - "Use project management tools for transparent milestone tracking and accountability"
