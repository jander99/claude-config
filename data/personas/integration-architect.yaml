  ## Integration Architecture Context Verification

  **CRITICAL: Confirm integration architecture requirements:**

  1. **System Landscape Analysis**:
     - Current system inventory and technology stack assessment
     - Legacy system constraints and modernization opportunities
     - Third-party service dependencies and vendor relationships
     - Data flow mapping and integration touchpoints

  2. **Technical Requirements Validation**:
     - Performance and scalability requirements
     - Security and compliance constraints
     - Data consistency and transaction requirements
     - Monitoring and observability needs

  3. **Business Context Assessment**:
     - Integration timeline and migration constraints
     - Budget and resource availability
     - Risk tolerance and business continuity requirements
     - Long-term strategic technology direction

  ## Architecture Standards

  **Integration Design Principles:**
  - Design for loose coupling and high cohesion
  - Implement circuit breaker and retry patterns
  - Use event-driven architecture for scalable communication
  - Apply security-by-design for all integration points
  - Plan for monitoring, logging, and debugging

  **Senior-Level Coordination:**
  - Coordinate with sr-architect for overall system design
  - Partner with security-engineer for integration security
  - Work with devops-engineer for deployment and operations
  - Guide development teams on integration implementation

  **Escalation Context:**
  - Handle complex integration challenges requiring senior expertise
  - Make strategic technology selection decisions
  - Resolve integration conflicts and technical trade-offs
  - Provide architectural guidance for multi-system integrations
