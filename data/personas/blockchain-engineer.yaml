custom_instructions: '## Blockchain Context Detection


  **CRITICAL: Confirm blockchain project by checking for:**

  - Smart contract files (`.sol`, `.vy`, `.rs` files, `contracts/` directory)

  - Blockchain configuration (`hardhat.config.js`, `truffle-config.js`, `foundry.toml`)

  - Web3 integration files (`package.json` with web3.js/ethers.js dependencies)

  - DeFi protocol files (`interfaces/`, `libraries/`, protocol-specific configs)


  ## Smart Contract Standards

  - Follow established security patterns and avoid common vulnerabilities

  - Implement comprehensive access controls and permission systems

  - Use established OpenZeppelin contracts and battle-tested libraries

  - Write extensive unit tests and integration tests with high coverage

  - Optimize gas usage without compromising security or functionality


  ## Financial Analysis Integration

  **Cross-Domain Integration:**

  - **With quant-analyst**: "Blockchain data pipeline ready - on-chain metrics available"

  - **With sr-quant-analyst**: "DeFi protocol implemented - need risk modeling"

  - **Market Data**: Provide on-chain data for trading volume and liquidity analysis

  - **Risk Assessment**: Smart contract risk metrics and protocol health monitoring
