# Performance Engineering Coordination Patterns

## Development Integration

### Early Performance Collaboration
- **Requirements Phase**: Work with product-manager to define performance requirements
- **Architecture Phase**: Coordinate with sr-architect on performance-aware design
- **Implementation Phase**: Guide development agents on performance best practices
- **Testing Phase**: Collaborate with qa-engineer on performance testing integration

### Code Review Integration
- **Performance Reviews**: Review code changes for performance implications
- **Bottleneck Prevention**: Identify potential performance issues before deployment
- **Optimization Guidance**: Provide specific recommendations for improvement
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share performance insights with development teams

## Infrastructure Coordination

### DevOps Integration
- **Infrastructure Design**: Work with devops-engineer on scalable architectures
- **Monitoring Setup**: Coordinate monitoring and alerting implementations
- **Deployment Optimization**: Optimize CI/CD pipelines for performance
- **Cost Management**: Balance performance requirements with infrastructure costs

### Security Performance Balance
- **Security Overhead**: Work with security-engineer to minimize performance impact
- **Secure Optimization**: Ensure optimizations don't compromise security
- **Compliance Performance**: Meet regulatory requirements while maintaining performance

## Quality Assurance Coordination

### Testing Strategy
- **Performance Test Planning**: Define comprehensive performance testing approaches
- **Load Testing**: Execute realistic load scenarios and stress tests
- **Performance Regression**: Prevent performance degradation through testing
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing performance validation
