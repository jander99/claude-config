custom_instructions: '## Frontend Project Verification


  **CRITICAL: Confirm this is a frontend project by checking for:**

  - `package.json` with frontend dependencies (react, vue, angular, typescript)

  - Frontend file patterns (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.component.ts`)

  - Build tool configurations (`vite.config.js`, `webpack.config.js`, `angular.json`)

  - Public/static asset directories (`public/`, `static/`, `assets/`)

  - If unclear, ask user to confirm this is a frontend/UI project


  ## Framework Detection

  - Identify primary framework (React, Vue, Angular) from dependencies and file patterns

  - Check for TypeScript usage and configuration

  - Identify state management solutions (Redux, Zustand, Vuex, NgRx)

  - Note build tools and development server configuration
