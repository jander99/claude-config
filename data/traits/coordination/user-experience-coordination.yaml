  ## User Experience Coordination

  **Consistent user experience is the foundation of great products**

  ### Design System Integration
  1. **Component Library Management**:
     - **Reusable Components**: Buttons, forms, navigation, modals
     - **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, breakpoints
     - **Interaction Patterns**: Hover states, transitions, micro-interactions
     - **Documentation**: Storybook, style guides, usage examples

  2. **Brand Consistency**:
     - **Visual Identity**: Logo usage, color palette, typography
     - **Voice and Tone**: Content style, messaging, error messages
     - **Accessibility**: Inclusive design, WCAG compliance
     - **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, progressive enhancement

  ### User-Centered Development
  ```
  UX Coordination Pipeline:
  User Research → Design Requirements Definition
  ↓
  frontend-engineer → Component implementation
  ↓
  Design Review → Consistency and usability validation
  ↓
  User Testing → Validation with real users
  ↓
  Iteration → Continuous improvement based on feedback
  ```

  ### User Experience Principles
  1. **Consistency**: Predictable patterns and interactions
  2. **Clarity**: Clear information hierarchy and calls-to-action
  3. **Efficiency**: Minimize cognitive load and task completion time
  4. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for all users and abilities
  5. **Responsiveness**: Feedback for all user actions

  ### Design-Development Handoff
  - **Design Specifications**: Figma, Sketch files with measurements
  - **Interactive Prototypes**: Clickable prototypes for complex flows
  - **Asset Management**: Optimized images, icons, illustrations
  - **Design QA**: Review implemented features against designs

  ### User Experience Metrics
  - **Usability Metrics**: Task completion rate, error rate, time on task
  - **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
  - **Engagement Metrics**: Page views, session duration, bounce rate
  - **Conversion Metrics**: Signup rate, purchase completion, feature adoption

  ### Cross-Platform Consistency
  - **Responsive Web**: Consistent experience across device sizes
  - **Progressive Web Apps**: Native-like experience on web
  - **Mobile Apps**: Platform-specific patterns while maintaining brand
  - **Desktop Applications**: OS-specific conventions with brand consistency

  ### Quality Assurance
  - **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated screenshot comparison
  - **Cross-Browser Testing**: Consistent experience across browsers
  - **Device Testing**: Physical device testing for mobile experiences
  - **Usability Testing**: Regular testing with real users

  ### Coordination Examples
  - "Design system components implemented - maintaining visual consistency"
  - "User journey optimized - checkout flow completion rate improved 15%"
  - "Responsive design implemented - mobile experience matches desktop quality"
  - "Accessibility review completed - design system meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
