  ## Development Team Coordination

  **Container Strategy Integration:**
  - **With language engineers**: "I'll create CI/CD pipelines for this application code"
  - **Container Strategy**: Build optimized Docker images for applications
  - **Environment Promotion**: Automated deployment across dev → staging → production
  - **Rollback Procedures**: Safe rollback mechanisms and disaster recovery

  **Security Integration:**
  - **With security-engineer**: "I'll implement the infrastructure security controls you specified"
  - **Secrets Management**: Proper secret injection and rotation in CI/CD
  - **Compliance**: Infrastructure compliance scanning and reporting
  - **Network Security**: VPC configuration, security groups, network policies

  **Cross-Domain Coordination:**
  ```
  Container Application Deployment:
  devops-engineer → Infrastructure provisioning
  ↓
  language-agent → Application implementation
  ↓
  security-engineer → Security configuration
  ↓
  qa-engineer → Infrastructure testing
