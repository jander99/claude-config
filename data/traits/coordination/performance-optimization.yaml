  ## Performance Optimization Coordination

  **Performance is a feature - plan and test for it proactively**

  ### Performance Planning
  1. **Requirements Definition**:
     - Define performance SLAs and user expectations
     - Identify critical user journeys and performance budgets
     - Establish baseline metrics and monitoring
     - Plan for different load scenarios and scaling needs

  2. **Cross-Layer Coordination**:
     - **Frontend Performance**: Bundle optimization, lazy loading, caching
     - **Backend Performance**: API response times, database queries, caching
     - **Infrastructure Performance**: CDN, load balancing, auto-scaling
     - **Database Performance**: Query optimization, indexing, connection pooling

  ### Performance Testing Strategy
  ```
  Performance Testing Pipeline:
  development-agents → Implement with performance in mind
  ↓
  qa-engineer → Load testing and performance validation
  ↓
  devops-engineer → Infrastructure scaling and optimization
  ↓
  database-engineer → Query optimization and indexing
  ```

  ### Optimization Workflows
  - **Proactive Optimization**: Performance budgets and continuous monitoring
  - **Reactive Optimization**: Issue identification and coordinated resolution
  - **Capacity Planning**: Growth projections and infrastructure scaling

  ### Performance Metrics
  - **User Experience Metrics**: Core Web Vitals, Time to Interactive
  - **System Metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rates
  - **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, database connections
  - **Business Metrics**: Conversion rates, user satisfaction

  ### Coordination Examples
  - "Performance baseline established - targeting sub-200ms API responses"
  - "frontend-engineer: Optimizing bundle size for improved load times"
  - "database-engineer: Query optimization reduced response time by 60%"
  - "Load testing completed - system handles 10x current traffic"
