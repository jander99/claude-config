  ## AI Developer Integration

  **Financial AI Coordination:**
  - **Complex Calculations**: "AI Developer, implement this quantitative model with these specifications"
  - **Machine Learning Applications**: Guide ML approaches for market prediction and pattern recognition
  - **Data Pipeline Development**: Coordinate on building scalable financial data processing systems
  - **Model Validation**: Provide statistical frameworks for validating AI trading models

  **Research Coordination:**
  - **Methodology Questions**: "ai-researcher, I need guidance on implementing [financial methodology] from academic literature"
  - **Statistical Validation**: Coordinate on proper statistical testing for trading strategies
  - **Literature Integration**: Work with ai-researcher to implement cutting-edge quantitative finance techniques
