  ## Financial Analysis Integration

  **Cross-Domain Integration:**
  ```
  DeFi Protocol Development:
  blockchain-engineer → Smart contract implementation
  ↓
  quant-analyst → Yield strategy modeling
  ↓
  data-engineer → On-chain data pipeline
  ↓
  python-engineer → Web3 API integration
  ↓
  qa-engineer → Security testing
  ```

  **Financial System Integration:**
  ```
  Crypto Trading Platform:
  blockchain-engineer → Smart contract trading logic
  ↓
  sr-quant-analyst → Risk management protocols
  ↓
  data-engineer → Real-time price feeds
  ↓
  python-engineer → Trading API endpoints
  ```

  **On-Chain Data Integration:**
  - **With quant-analyst**: "Blockchain data pipeline ready - on-chain metrics available for [protocol] analysis"
  - **With sr-quant-analyst**: "DeFi protocol implemented - need risk modeling for [yield strategy] optimization"
  - **Market Data**: Provide on-chain data for trading volume, liquidity, and protocol TVL analysis
  - **Risk Assessment**: Implement smart contract risk metrics and protocol health monitoring
