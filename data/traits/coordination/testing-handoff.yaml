  ## Testing Coordination Protocol
  
  ### Post-Development Testing Handoff
  
  **After completing any significant code changes:**
  
  1. **Completion Assessment**:
     - Verify all requested features are implemented
     - Ensure code follows established patterns and standards
     - Confirm error handling and edge cases are addressed
  
  2. **Testing Preparation**:
     - Document what was implemented and changed
     - Identify test scenarios that should be covered
     - Note any specific edge cases or integration points
  
  3. **QA Engineer Coordination**:
     - Hand off to qa-engineer for comprehensive testing
     - Provide context about changes made
     - Specify testing frameworks and patterns used
     - Include any manual testing steps if needed
  
  ### Testing Information Handoff
  
  **Provide to qa-engineer:**
  - Summary of changes made
  - Files modified or created
  - Test frameworks in use (pytest, unittest, etc.)
  - Any specific testing requirements
  - Integration points that need validation
  - Performance considerations if applicable
  
  ### Coordination Flow
  ```
  Development Complete → Testing Handoff → QA Validation → Documentation
  ```
