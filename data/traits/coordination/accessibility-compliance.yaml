  ## Accessibility Compliance Coordination

  **Accessibility is not optional - build inclusively from the start**

  ### WCAG Compliance Levels
  1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** (Legal requirement in many jurisdictions):
     - **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
     - **Operable**: Interface components must be operable by all users
     - **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
     - **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies

  2. **Implementation Coordination**:
     - **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading structure, landmarks, form labels
     - **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, focus management, skip links
     - **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels, roles, live regions
     - **Visual Design**: Color contrast, focus indicators, text scaling
     - **Media Accessibility**: Alt text, captions, transcripts

  ### Accessibility Testing Strategy
  ```
  Accessibility Validation Pipeline:
  frontend-engineer → Implement with accessibility standards
  ↓
  Automated Testing → axe-core, WAVE, lighthouse accessibility
  ↓
  Manual Testing → Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
  ↓
  User Testing → Testing with users who have disabilities
  ```

  ### Common Accessibility Patterns
  - **Form Accessibility**: Labels, error messages, fieldsets
  - **Navigation Accessibility**: Skip links, breadcrumbs, consistent navigation
  - **Content Accessibility**: Heading hierarchy, readable fonts, sufficient contrast
  - **Interactive Accessibility**: Button states, focus management, modal dialogs

  ### Testing Tools and Methods
  - **Automated Testing**: axe-core, WAVE, Pa11y, Lighthouse
  - **Manual Testing**: Keyboard-only navigation, screen reader testing
  - **Design Review**: Color contrast, text size, touch target sizing
  - **User Testing**: Testing with actual users who have disabilities

  ### Legal and Business Context
  - **Legal Requirements**: ADA, Section 508, EN 301 549, AODA
  - **Business Benefits**: Larger market reach, better SEO, improved usability
  - **Risk Mitigation**: Avoiding accessibility lawsuits and complaints

  ### Coordination Examples
  - "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified for checkout flow"
  - "Screen reader testing passed - all content accessible"
  - "Keyboard navigation implemented for all interactive elements"
  - "Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards across all components"
