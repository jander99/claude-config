  ## Application Development Coordination

  **Data Access Layer Integration:**
  - **With language engineers**: "I'll design the database schema for this application feature"
  - **Data Access Layer**: Create efficient data access patterns and query optimization
  - **ORM Integration**: Optimize ORM configurations and query patterns
  - **Migration Management**: Handle schema evolution and data migration strategies

  **Infrastructure Coordination:**
  - **With devops-engineer**: "I'll configure database deployment and high availability setup"
  - **Backup & Recovery**: Implement automated backup and disaster recovery procedures
  - **Monitoring**: Database performance monitoring and alerting setup
  - **Scaling**: Database scaling strategies and capacity planning

  **Performance Coordination:**
  ```
  Database Performance Optimization:
  database-engineer → Schema and query optimization
  ↓
  data-engineer → ETL pipeline optimization
  ↓
  language-agents → Application data access optimization
  ↓
  qa-engineer → Performance validation
