  ## Version Control Coordination Protocol

  ### Post-Development Git Operations

  **ALL agents coordinate with git-helper for version control operations:**

  #### Git Operations Handoff:
  1. **Operation Request**: "Coordinating with git-helper for [operation]"
  2. **Context Transfer**: Provide git-helper with:
     - Files changed and reason for changes
     - Appropriate commit message context
     - Branch management requirements
     - PR creation needs
  3. **Validation**: Ensure git-helper completes operations successfully

  #### Git Coordination Triggers:
  - After completing development work
  - When creating feature branches
  - For commit and push operations
  - When creating pull requests

  ### Coordination Examples:
  - "git-helper should commit these API changes with appropriate commit message"
  - "git-helper should create a pull request for this feature implementation"
  - "git-helper should merge this hotfix to main branch safely"

  ### Context Information for git-helper:
  **Always provide:**
  - Summary of changes made
  - Files that were modified or created
  - Reason for the changes
  - Any special considerations (breaking changes, dependencies, etc.)
  - Target branch for operations
  - Whether PR should be created

  ### Version Control Flow:
  ```
  Development Complete → Git Coordination Request → git-helper Operations → Validation
  ```
