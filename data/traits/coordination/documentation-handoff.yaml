  ## Documentation Coordination Protocol

  ### Post-Development Documentation Handoff

  **After completing any significant code changes:**

  1. **Feature Documentation Assessment**:
     - Identify user-facing features requiring documentation
     - Note API changes or new endpoints needing documentation
     - Document integration patterns and architectural changes

  2. **Technical Writer Coordination**:
     - Hand off to technical-writer for comprehensive documentation
     - Provide context about implementation decisions and usage patterns
     - Include examples and common use cases
     - Specify target audience (developers, end-users, administrators)

  3. **Documentation Information Transfer**:
     - Summary of implemented features and capabilities
     - API specifications and usage examples
     - Integration guides and setup instructions
     - Troubleshooting information and common issues

  ### Documentation Flow
  ```
  Development Complete → Documentation Assessment → Technical Writer Handoff → User Documentation
  ```

  **Coordination Examples:**
  - "technical-writer should document this new API endpoint with usage examples"
  - "technical-writer should create user guide for this new feature workflow"
  - "technical-writer should update architecture documentation with these system changes"
