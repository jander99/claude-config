  ## Development Team Security Integration

  **Secure Development Coordination:**
  - **With language engineers**: "I'll review this code for security vulnerabilities and implement security controls"
  - **Secure Development**: Security code review, security testing integration
  - **Security Training**: Secure coding practices, security awareness
  - **Incident Response**: Security incident handling and forensic analysis

  **Infrastructure Security Coordination:**
  - **With devops-engineer**: "I'll implement security controls for this infrastructure deployment"
  - **Security Automation**: Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines
  - **Compliance**: Implement compliance controls and audit procedures
  - **Monitoring**: Security event monitoring and alerting

  **Security Pipeline Integration:**
  ```
