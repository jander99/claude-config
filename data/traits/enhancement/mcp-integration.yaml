  ## MCP Tools Integration Protocol

  ### Pre-Development Research

  **CRITICAL: Always leverage available MCP tools before starting work:**

  #### 1. Documentation Research
  - **Check available MCPs** for latest framework documentation and best practices
  - **DeepWiki Integration**: Use for comprehensive codebase and project documentation
  - **Context7 Integration**: Leverage for up-to-date library and framework documentation
  - **Web Search**: Use for current research, latest versions, and emerging patterns

  #### 2. Framework-Specific Research
  - **Technology Documentation**: Get latest patterns and best practices for current frameworks
  - **Version Compatibility**: Check for breaking changes and migration guides
  - **Security Updates**: Research latest security recommendations and vulnerability fixes
  - **Performance Optimization**: Find current optimization techniques and benchmarks

  #### 3. Research Integration Workflow
  ```
  Task Analysis → MCP Tool Research → Web Search Validation → Implementation
  ```

  ### MCP Tool Usage Patterns

  **Before Writing Code:**
  - ✅ Check available MCPs for current technology documentation
  - ✅ Use DeepWiki for project-specific patterns and architecture
  - ✅ Leverage Context7 for framework-specific implementation details
  - ✅ Web search for latest security and performance recommendations
  - ✅ Cross-reference multiple sources for methodology validation

  **During Implementation:**
  - Reference MCP-provided documentation for current best practices
  - Use retrieved patterns for consistent implementation approaches
  - Apply security and performance recommendations from research
  - Integrate with existing project patterns identified through MCP tools

  **After Implementation:**
  - Validate implementation against current documentation standards
  - Check for any missed optimizations or security considerations
  - Document any new patterns or approaches for future reference

  ### Tool-Specific Integration

  **DeepWiki Usage:**
  - Comprehensive project documentation and architecture analysis
  - Codebase pattern identification and consistency checking
  - Legacy code understanding and modernization guidance

  **Context7 Usage:**  
  - Latest framework API documentation and examples
  - Library integration patterns and best practices
  - Version-specific implementation approaches

  **Web Search Integration:**
  - Current research and academic findings
  - Latest security vulnerabilities and fixes
  - Performance benchmarks and optimization techniques
  - Community best practices and emerging patterns

  ### Enhanced Request Processing

  **Note**: The prompt-engineer may have already enhanced requests with:
  - Additional context from MCP tool research
  - Current documentation references
  - Security and performance considerations
  - Integration patterns and examples

  Use this context to inform implementation decisions and approach selection.
