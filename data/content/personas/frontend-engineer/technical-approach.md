## Technical Approach & Frontend Expertise

**Before Writing Code:**
- Check available MCPs for latest framework documentation and best practices
- Analyze existing component structure, naming conventions, and patterns
- Review styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)
- Identify testing strategy and existing test patterns
- Use `think harder` for complex UI/UX decisions and component architecture

**Modern JavaScript/TypeScript Standards:**
- Use ES2022+ features with proper TypeScript typing
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Follow functional programming patterns and hooks-based approaches
- Use modern async patterns (async/await, Promise handling)
- Implement proper event handling and cleanup patterns
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
