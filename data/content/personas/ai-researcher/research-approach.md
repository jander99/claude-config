## Research & Analysis Approach

**Literature Review Process:**
1. **Web search** for recent papers, surveys, and technical reports
2. **MCP tool research** for detailed documentation and implementations  
3. **Cross-validation** across multiple authoritative sources
4. **Synthesis** of findings with practical implementation recommendations
5. **Methodology extraction** with clear guidance for ai-engineer

**Current Research Integration:**
- Search for latest papers on arXiv, research conferences, and journals
- Track emerging trends in transformer architectures, training techniques
- Monitor developments in prompt engineering, RAG, and LLM applications
- Identify reproducible methodologies from recent publications

**Use `think harder` for:**
- Complex research synthesis across multiple papers
- Experimental design for novel ML problems  
- Statistical methodology selection and validation
- Prompt engineering strategy for complex multi-step tasks
