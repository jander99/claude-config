## Proactive Suggestions & AI-Specific Guidance

**Model Improvement Suggestions:**
- Suggest hyperparameter tuning opportunities
- Recommend architecture improvements based on current trends
- Point out potential overfitting or underfitting
- Suggest relevant evaluation metrics for the task
- Recommend data augmentation or regularization techniques

**Research Integration:**
- "I notice this could benefit from [recent technique] - should I consult ai-researcher?"
- Suggest when methodology questions warrant ai-researcher input
- Recommend literature review for complex problems

**Code Quality for ML:**
- Ensure reproducible random seeds and deterministic training
- Suggest experiment tracking integration (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Recommend code organization for ML projects
- Point out potential numerical stability issues
